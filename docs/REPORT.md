# Symmetry Applicant Showcase App - Project Report

## 1. Introduction

When I first encountered this project, I felt a mix of excitement and challenge. The scope was clear: build a news application where users can publish their own articles. What stood out immediately was Symmetry's emphasis on Clean Architecture and their three core values - Truth is King, Total Accountability, and Maximally Overdeliver.

My experience coming into this project included solid programming fundamentals, but Flutter, Firebase, and BLoC were completly new territories for me. This presented both a challenge and an opportunity to demonstrate my capacity to learn quickly and deliver quality code.

## 2. Learning Journey

### Technologies Learned

**Flutter Framework**

- Started with some videos in youtube that explains what is Flutter, when is useful and how to use it. Some basic tutorials to get to know the tool.
- Then i started reading the official Flutter documentation
- Focused on understanding widgets, state management, and the Flutter rendering pipeline
- Practiced building UI components helping myself with some youtube tutorials and the explanations of some AI tools of certain things that i was missing.

**Firebase Ecosystem**

- Same as i did with Flutter, i started with some videos in youtube where i can see what is Firbase about.
- I have a solid with the rules thing because i have used SUPABASE in the past and it is very similar with the "Row Level Security".
- Understand how NoSQL design works because i have always work with SQL database in the past
- Implemented Firestore Database
- Claim my free credit in my account so i can have access to multiple tools inside of a Firebase project
- Implemented Firebase Cloud Storage for image handling
- Implement Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In and Email/Password)

**Flutter BLoC & State Management**

- Studied the BLoC pattern and Cubit architecture
- Learned how to separate business logic from presentation
- Implemented proper state management using flutter_bloc package

**Clean Architecture**

- Deeply studied the three-layer architecture (Data, Domain, Presentation)
- Understood dependency inversion and how domain layer stays pure Dart
- Learned to properly separate concerns between layers
- Implemented repository patterns and use cases

### Resources Utilized

1. Official Flutter documentation and tutorials
2. BLoC library documentation and video tutorials
3. Firebase documentation for Firestore, Auth, and Storage
4. YouTube tutorials on Clean Architecture with Flutter
5. Stack Overflow and Flutter community forums for specific implementation challenges
6. AI tools to give me explanations on certain things that i was missing or falling short.

### Application of Knowledge

The knowledge was applied systematically:

1. First designed the database schema following NoSQL best practices
2. Built the domain layer with entities and repository interfaces
3. Implemented data layer with Firestore integration
4. Created presentation layer with proper state management
5. Iteratively tested and refined each component

## 3. Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Understanding Clean Architecture Boundaries

**Problem:** Initially struggled with understanding where code should live - particularly the distinction between models and entities.

**Solution:** Re-read the architecture documentation multiple times and studied the existing codebase structure. Realized that entities are pure business objects while models handle data transformation from external sources.

**Lesson Learned:** Clean Architecture requires discipline and careful planning, but pays dividends in maintainability and testability.

### Challenge 2: Firestore Data Modeling

**Problem:** Coming from a SQL background, NoSQL data modeling was conceptually different. Struggled with deciding between subcollections and embedded data.

**Solution:** Researched Firestore best practices, particularly query performance. Decided to use subcollections for user-specific data like bookmarks to maintain proper data isolation.

**Lesson Learned:** NoSQL requires thinking in terms of access patterns rather than normalized data structures.

### Challenge 3: State Management with BLoC

**Problem:** Understanding when to emit new states and how to handle loading/error states consistently across features.

**Solution:** Created a consistent pattern for all cubits - always start with loading state, handle errors with specific error states, and emit success states with data. Used sealed classes for type-safe state handling.

**Lesson Learned:** Consistent patterns across the codebase make it easier to reason about state management and catch bugs early.

### Challenge 4: Firebase Authentication Integration

**Problem:** Managing authentication state across the app and ensuring proper user context for operations like article publishing and bookmarking.

**Solution:** Created an AuthCubit that manages authentication state globally, then passed user context to other cubits that need it. Implemented proper Firebase Auth listeners to track auth state changes.

**Lesson Learned:** Authentication should be centralized and other features should depend on it through well-defined interfaces.

### Challenge 5: User-Specific Bookmarks Implementation

**Problem:** Initially implemented bookmarks as a boolean field on articles, which made bookmarks global rather than per-user.

**Solution:** Redesigned the architecture to use Firestore subcollections (`users/{userId}/favorites/{articleId}`), ensuring complete data isolation between users. Updated the entire data flow from datasource to presentation layer.

**Lesson Learned:** Database design has cascading effects throughout the architecture. It's worth investing time upfront to design data structures properly.

## 7. Extra Sections

### Code Quality Metrics

**Architecture Compliance:**

- âœ… All features follow Clean Architecture principles
- âœ… Domain layer has zero Flutter/external dependencies
- âœ… Proper separation of concerns across layers
- âœ… Repository pattern implemented correctly

**State Management:**

- âœ… Consistent use of Cubit pattern
- âœ… Proper state classes (Loading, Success, Error)
- âœ… No direct UI-to-database communication

**Firebase Integration:**

- âœ… Firestore rules enforce schema
- âœ… Proper authentication flow
- âœ… Secure storage access
- âœ… Real-time data synchronization

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Decision 1: Cubit vs BLoC

**Choice:** Used Cubit for state management instead of full BLoC

**Rationale:** Cubits provide simpler API for most use cases in this app. The added complexity of events in BLoC wasn't necessary for the current feature set.

**Trade-off:** BLoC would provide better testability and event tracking, but Cubit offers faster development and easier understanding for this project scope.

#### Decision 2: Subcollections for User Data

**Choice:** Used Firestore subcollections for user-specific data (bookmarks)

**Rationale:** Provides natural data isolation, easier querying, and better security rules granularity.

**Trade-off:** More complex queries when needing to aggregate data across users, but much better for data privacy and security.

#### Decision 3: Firebase Cloud Storage for Images

**Choice:** Used Firebase Cloud Storage rather than embedding images as base64 or using external CDN

**Rationale:** Integrates seamlessly with Firebase ecosystem, provides good performance, and includes built-in security rules.

**Trade-off:** Tied to Firebase ecosystem, but acceptable given project requirements.

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start with Architecture:** Time invested in understanding and planning Clean Architecture paid off significantly in development speed and code quality.

2. **Database Design Matters:** The user-specific bookmarks refactoring showed how important it is to get database design right the first time.

3. **Documentation is Development:** Writing DB_SCHEMA.md and maintaining documentation helped clarify thinking and made implementation smoother.

4. **State Management Consistency:** Having consistent patterns for state management across all cubits made debugging and feature addition much easier.

5. **Test Early:** Should have written tests alongside feature development rather than planning to add them later.

### Alignment with Symmetry Values
